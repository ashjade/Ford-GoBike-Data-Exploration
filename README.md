# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Ashwell Dickson


## Dataset

> This dataset consists of information on bike riding trips captured on the Ford GoBike ride sharing system. The data in this dataset covers the San Francisco bay area. This dataset initialy included 183,411 recorded trips, after cleaning the dataset to be used for analysis I was left with 174,951 records of trips. These trips had 16 attributes that give further information on the trip and the user.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration I identified the the dependent measure to be the duration_sec values and investigated which other variables it shared any relationships with. Through the univariate exploration on the trip duration I found that most members like to go for leisurely short distanced trips and few actually took the longer trips. By exploring the members age I also found that the age of the majority of the rider fall between age 20 and 40, so quite a younger group. Most of the members are also males.

> When zooming in on the genders and it's trip duratition we saw that the males has the lowest median trip duration, this can be due to the most of the dataset consisting of male data and most of the data is distributed at the lower end of trip ditribution.

> The Subscriber makes up majority of user type over Customer, but Customer has the highest trip durations.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The younger aged members, aged between 20 and 40 years have the highest data distribution for higher values on the trip duration.
